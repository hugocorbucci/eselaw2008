In this paper, we described an approach that tries to overcome the XP constraint of co-location by introducing a process-support environment (called MILOS for Agile Software Engineering - MILOS ASE) that helps software development teams to maintain XP practices in a distributed setting. MILOS ASE supports project coordination using the planning game, user stories, information routing, team communication, and pair programming.},

		 programmers work together at one computer,
		 collaborating on the same design, algorithm, code or
		 test. Studies have shown that pair programmers produce
		 higher quality code in essentially the same amount of
		 time as solo programmers. Additional benefits include
		 increased job satisfaction, improved team
		 communication, and efficient tacit knowledge sharing.
		 However, it may not always be possible for all team
		 members to be collocated due to the rise in teleworking
		 and geographically distributed teams. This paper
		 analyzes the results of two distributed pair
		 programming experiments administered at North Carolina
		 State University. Experiment participants used readily
		 available off-the-shelf applications for collaborative
		 development. The results of the experiments indicate
		 that virtual collaboration by distributed pair
		 programmers is on par with collocated collaboration."
